# Flickr Search

Flickr Search is a web application that enables the user to search Flickr by tag and see matching images in a nicely arranged format.
It performs basic user auth before allowing access, storing the user's tokens in local storage.
Express is used as the backend framework, and React as the frontend framework.  

To run Flickr Search, run 'npm i' from the main directory to install dependencies. 
Then run 'npm start' from the /client directory, and 'nodemon' from the /server directory
